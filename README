                 --------------------------------

Gestinanna::POF::Repository manages a revision controlled data store 
based on Gestinanna::POF::Alzabo.

This package uses CVS as its model but with some differences:

 o Objects may not be deleted

 o If a revision greater than the currently modified one already 
   exists, a branch is forced (e.g., if saving a modification to 
   revision 1.2 and revision 1.3 already exists, then a branch is 
   forced, creating a revision similar to 1.2.1.1 (or the first 
   available branch number under 1.2) )

 o This module does not track blame information -- blame tracking 
   implementation is application-dependent

 o An object may have multiple attributes under revision control


To install Gestinanna::POF::Repository, download the distribution, 
untar, and cd into the resulting directory.  There, run the following:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

or

  % perl Build.PL
  % ./Build
  % ./Build test
  % ./Build install

Tests require the Alzabo package and DBD::SQLite as well as 
Gestinanna::POF.

All modules required for testing and use are available on CPAN.

The author lurks on both the mod_perl list as well as various IRC channels.  
Feel free to send questions there.

N.B.: The manner in which differences are tracked has changed.  You 
will need to reload any documents you stored using an older version of 
this module.  This will only happen again if there are major bugs 
whose fix requires a different data structure.
