                 --------------------------------

Gestinanna::POF::Repository manages a revision controlled data store 
based on Gestinanna::POF::Alzabo.

This package uses CVS as its model but with some differences:

 o Objects may not be deleted

 o If a revision greater than the currently modified one already 
   exists, a branch is forced (e.g., if saving a modification to 
   revision 1.2 and revision 1.3 already exists, then a branch is 
   forced, creating a revision similar to 1.2.1.1 (or the first 
   available branch number under 1.2) )

 o This module does not track blame information -- blame tracking 
   implementation is application-dependent

 o An object may have multiple attributes under revision control


To install Gestinanna::POF::Repository, download the distribution, 
untar, and cd into the resulting directory.  There, run the following:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

or

  % perl Build.PL
  % ./Build
  % ./Build test
  % ./Build install

Tests require the Alzabo package and DBD::SQLite as well as 
Gestinanna::POF.

All modules required for testing and use are available on CPAN.

The author lurks on both the mod_perl list as well as various IRC channels.
